# Planning a Full Stack Project with AI Assistance

In this guide, we'll use AI to help us plan a comprehensive full stack project that brings together all the technologies and concepts we've learned. By leveraging AI throughout the planning process, we can create a robust architecture and development plan.

## Defining the Project with AI Guidance

Let's start by defining our project:

1. Ask your AI: "I want to create a full stack e-commerce application using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and microservices architecture. What features should it include to showcase my skills while remaining manageable for a learning project?"

2. Based on the AI's suggestions, define the core features of your application. For example:
   - User authentication and profiles
   - Product catalog with search and filtering
   - Shopping cart and checkout process
   - Order management and history
   - Admin dashboard for product management

3. Refine the scope with follow-up questions like: "Which features should I prioritize? What would be considered MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project?"

## Architectural Planning with AI

Let's design the architecture of our application:

1. Ask your AI: "Can you help me design a microservices architecture for my e-commerce application? What services should I create, and what should each one do?"

2. Ask for a visual representation: "Can you describe a system architecture diagram for this e-commerce application that I could create? Include all services, databases, message queues, and how they connect."

3. Based on the AI's guidance, create an architecture diagram using a tool like draw.io or excalidraw

4. Ask follow-up questions like: "How should these services communicate? Which operations should be synchronous vs. asynchronous?"

## Database Schema Design with AI

Let's design the database schema for our application:

1. Ask your AI: "Can you help me design the database schema for my e-commerce application? Include tables for users, products, orders, etc., with fields and relationships."

2. Ask for visual representation: "Can you describe an entity-relationship diagram for these tables that I could create?"

3. Create your schema diagrams based on the AI's guidance

4. Ask for SQL: "Can you provide the SQL statements to create these tables in PostgreSQL?"

## API Design with AI

Let's design the APIs for our services:

1. For each service, ask your AI: "What REST API endpoints should my [Service Name] expose? Include HTTP methods, URLs, request/response formats, and authentication requirements."

2. Ask for OpenAPI specifications: "Can you provide an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for these endpoints?"

3. Document the API designs for each service

## Frontend Architecture Planning with AI

Let's design the frontend architecture:

1. Ask your AI: "How should I structure my React application for this e-commerce project? What component hierarchy would you recommend?"

2. Ask for state management guidance: "What state management approach would you recommend for this application? How should I organize global vs. local state?"

3. Ask for routing: "How should I set up routing for this application? What routes would I need?"

4. Create component diagrams and structure documents based on the AI's guidance

## DevOps and Deployment Planning with AI

Let's plan our deployment strategy:

1. Ask your AI: "What would be an appropriate deployment strategy for my microservices e-commerce application? Consider Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers."

2. Ask for CI/CD guidance: "Can you suggest a CI/CD pipeline for this application? What steps should it include?"

3. Ask for infrastructure-as-code: "What infrastructure-as-code approach would you recommend for this project?"

4. Document the deployment plan based on the AI's recommendations

## Project Timeline and Task Breakdown with AI

Let's create a development plan:

1. Ask your AI: "Can you help me create a development plan for this e-commerce application? Break it down into phases with specific tasks, and estimate the time each phase might take."

2. Ask for prioritization: "Which components or services should I develop first? What would be a logical order of development?"

3. Create a project timeline and task breakdown document based on the AI's guidance

## Setting Up the Project Structure with AI

Now that we have our plan, let's set up the project structure:

1. Ask your AI: "Can you help me set up the folder structure for this entire project? I want to organize it as a monorepo with separate folders for each microservice and the frontend."

2. Create the suggested folder structure

3. For each service and the frontend, ask: "What files should I create in the [Service Name] folder to set up a minimal starting point? Please provide file names and contents."

4. Create the initial files using AI-generated content

## Version Control Strategy with AI

Let's plan our version control strategy:

1. Ask your AI: "What version control strategy would you recommend for this project? How should I organize branches and manage pull requests?"

2. Ask for Git workflow: "Can you describe a Git workflow for this project? Include branching strategies, commit conventions, and PR process."

3. Set up your Git repository with the recommended structure and documentation

## Next Steps

Now that you have a comprehensive plan for your project, proceed to [02-Backend-Implementation.md](./02-Backend-Implementation.md) to start implementing the backend services with AI assistance.
