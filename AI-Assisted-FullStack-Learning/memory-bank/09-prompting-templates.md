2. New architecture design
3. Potential risks and how to mitigate them
4. How to ensure functionality during the refactoring
```

## Learning Exercise Templates

### Project Planning

```
Help me plan a learning project to practice [specific skills]:

The project should:
1. Be completable within [time frame]
2. Focus on [specific technologies]
3. Include [specific features or technical challenges]
4. Be suitable for my [beginner/intermediate/advanced] skill level

Please provide:
1. Project concept and scope
2. Technical requirements
3. Implementation steps
4. Learning goals for each component
```

### Bug Challenge

```
Create a debugging challenge for me to solve involving [technology/concept]:

1. Provide a code snippet with a deliberate bug
2. Give me context about what the code should do
3. Include hints of increasing specificity if I get stuck
4. Explain the underlying concept or pattern after I solve it
```

## Implementation Templates

### Docker Configuration

```
Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for a [project type] with:
- [Service 1 requirements]
- [Service 2 requirements]
- [Service 3 requirements]

Include:
1. Proper base images
2. Efficient layer caching
3. Volume mapping for development
4. Environment variable configuration
5. Network setup between services
6. Commands for building and running
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```
Design a CI/CD pipeline for a [project type] using [GitHub Actions/Jenkins/etc.]:

Requirements:
1. Run tests on pull requests
2. Build and push Docker images
3. Deploy to [staging/production environment]
4. Include security scanning
5. Performance and accessibility testing

Please provide the configuration files and explanation of each step.
```

## Troubleshooting Templates

### Performance Optimization

```
I'm experiencing performance issues with my [application type]:
[Describe symptoms and context]

Here's relevant code/configuration:
[Code snippets or configuration files]

Please help me:
1. Identify potential bottlenecks
2. Suggest optimization strategies
3. Recommend tools for profiling and monitoring
4. Prioritize optimizations by impact
```

### Security Review

## How to Adapt Templates

These templates are starting points. For best results, customize them by:

1. Adding specific context about your current project
2. Mentioning your skill level and familiarity with concepts
3. Specifying what you've already tried
4. Including technologies and frameworks you're using
5. Setting constraints (e.g., "must work with existing architecture")

The more specific your prompts, the more useful the AI's responses will be.
