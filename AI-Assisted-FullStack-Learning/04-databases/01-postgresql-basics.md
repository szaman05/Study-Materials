## PostgreSQL Fundamentals

### What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that:
- Complies with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties
- Supports complex queries, foreign keys, triggers, views, and stored procedures
- Handles complex data types including JSON, arrays, and geometric data
- Provides robust transaction support
- Offers excellent scalability and performance

### Relational Database Concepts

Key concepts in relational databases:
- **Tables**: Collections of rows and columns storing related data
- **Schemas**: Logical groupings of tables and other objects
- **Relationships**: Connections between tables (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for rows
- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in other tables
- **Constraints**: Rules that enforce data integrity
- **Indexes**: Data structures that improve query performance
- **Transactions**: Groups of operations treated as a single unit

## Practical Exercises with AI Guidance

### Exercise 1: Database Design

```
I need to design a database for a job board application with the following requirements:
- Companies can post multiple job listings
- Job seekers can create profiles and apply to jobs
- Job listings can have multiple skills/requirements
- Applications can have different statuses (applied, reviewed, interviewed, offered, rejected)

Can you help me design this database schema with SQL to create all necessary tables?
```

### Exercise 2: Complex Queries

```
Using the job board database schema, help me write SQL queries to:
1. Find all applications for a specific job listing with applicant details
2. Get the top 5 companies with the most job listings
3. Find job listings matching a job seeker's skills
4. Calculate the average application-to-interview conversion rate for each company
5. Find job listings with no applications in the last 30 days
```

### Exercise 3: Node.js Integration

```
I want to build a RESTful API for the job board using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. Can you help me:
1. Set up the database connection
2. Create route handlers for job listings (CRUD)
3. Implement a search endpoint with filtering options
4. Create an endpoint for job applications
5. Implement authentication and user-specific queries

Please provide the necessary code for these features.
```

## Troubleshooting with AI

When you encounter issues, AI can help diagnose and fix them:

```
I'm getting this error when trying to run a query: "ERROR: relation "users" does not exist". What might be causing this and how can I fix it?
```

```
My queries are running slowly after adding more data to my database. How can I identify performance bottlenecks and optimize my queries?
```

```
I'm trying to implement a foreign key constraint, but getting an error. Here's my SQL: [paste SQL]. What might be wrong with it?
```

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted PostgreSQL Development

1. **Ask for explanations, not just code:**
   ```
   In addition to the SQL query, can you explain the execution plan and why this approach is efficient?
   ```

2. **Have AI review your database designs:**
   ```
   Here's my current schema for a social media application: [paste schema]. Are there any potential issues with this design in terms of normalization, performance, or scalability?
   ```

3. **Use AI for learning complex concepts:**
   ```
   Can you explain PostgreSQL's MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) model in simple terms? How does it impact transaction behavior?
   ```

4. **Get help with optimization:**
   ```
   This query is running slowly: [paste query]. Can you suggest ways to optimize it, including possible index changes?
   ```

## PostgreSQL Cheat Sheet
