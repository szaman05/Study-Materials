# Capstone Project Planning with AI Assistance

## Introduction

Planning a full-stack microservices application is a complex task that requires careful consideration of architecture, technology choices, and implementation strategies. In this guide, we'll use AI assistance to help plan a comprehensive capstone project that brings together all the skills you've learned throughout this course.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to effectively plan a complex full-stack application
- Use AI to help with architecture decisions and technology choices
- Create a detailed project roadmap with AI assistance
- Identify potential challenges and mitigate risks
- Set up a development workflow optimized for AI collaboration

## Capstone Project Overview

For our capstone project, we'll build a **JobHub** platform - a job posting and application tracking system with the following features:

- User authentication and profile management
- Job posting and search
- Application submission and tracking
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics dashboard
- Admin management panel

This application will leverage a microservices architecture with the following core services:
- Auth Service (user management and authentication)
- Job Service (job postings and search)
- Application Service (application processing)
- Notification Service (real-time updates)
- Analytics Service (data processing and reports)

## Planning with AI Assistance

### Step 1: Defining Project Requirements

Start by asking the AI to help refine and expand project requirements:

```
I want to build a job posting and application platform called JobHub. It should allow companies to post jobs, job seekers to search and apply for positions, and both parties to track applications. What specific features would be essential for this platform? What optional features might enhance the user experience?
```

After receiving the AI's suggestions, refine further:

```
Based on these features, can you help me prioritize them into "must-have" vs "nice-to-have" categories? Which features would be critical for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release?
```

### Step 2: Architectural Planning

Ask the AI for architectural guidance:

```
For the JobHub platform, I'm planning to use a microservices architecture. Given the following services: Auth, Job, Application, Notification, and Analytics, can you suggest:
1. How these services should communicate with each other
2. What database technology would be appropriate for each service
3. How to handle shared data between services
4. Any additional services I might need
```

Drill down into specific aspects:

```
For the Authentication service, what security measures should I implement? How should I handle authentication across different services? Should I use JWT, OAuth, or another approach?
```

### Step 3: Technology Stack Selection

Get AI input on technology choices:

```
For the JobHub platform, I'm considering the following tech stack:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Databases: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for user profiles and job postings
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ for event communication
- Search: Elasticsearch for job search functionality
- Caching: Redis for performance optimization
- Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes

What are your thoughts on these choices? Are there any alternatives I should consider for specific components? Any potential issues with this stack?
```

### Step 4: Data Modeling

Use AI to help with data modeling:

```
For the JobHub platform, can you help me design the data models for the following entities:
1. User (includes both job seekers and employers)
2. Company
3. Job Posting
4. Job Application
5. User Notification

For each, please suggest the fields, relationships, and which database they should be stored in.
```

### Step 5: API Design

Ask the AI to design your API endpoints:

```
For the Job Service in the JobHub platform, please design a RESTful API that would handle:
1. Creating new job postings
2. Updating existing jobs
3. Searching jobs with various filters
4. Getting detailed job information
5. Managing job status (active, filled, expired)

Include endpoints, HTTP methods, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
```

### Step 6: UI/UX Planning

Get AI assistance with user interface design:

```
For the JobHub platform, I need to design the job search and filtering interface. Users should be able to search by keyword, location, job type, salary range, and experience level. Can you suggest a clean, user-friendly layout for this page, describing the components and their arrangement?
```

```
For the employer dashboard in JobHub, what key metrics and information should be displayed? How should I organize this information for clarity and ease of use?
```

### Step 7: Development Roadmap

Create a development roadmap with AI help:

```
Based on our discussions about the JobHub platform, can you create a development roadmap with the following phases:
1. MVP phase (core functionality only)
2. Beta release (additional important features)
3. Full release (complete feature set)

For each phase, list the specific features, services, and components that should be developed, in a logical order of implementation.
```

### Step 8: Testing Strategy

Plan your testing approach:

```
For the JobHub platform with its microservices architecture, what testing strategy would you recommend? Please include:
1. Types of tests needed for each service
2. Tools and frameworks for testing
3. Approaches to test service interactions
4. How to set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
```

### Step 9: Deployment Planning

Get AI guidance on deployment:

```
I plan to deploy the JobHub platform using Docker and Kubernetes. Can you outline a deployment strategy, including:
1. Container organization
2. Kubernetes resource configurations
3. Scaling considerations
4. Monitoring and observability setup
5. Backup and disaster recovery plans
```

### Step 10: Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks with AI assistance:

```
What are the potential technical risks and challenges in building the JobHub platform with the architecture and technologies we've discussed? For each risk, can you suggest mitigation strategies?
```

## Creating Detailed Documentation

### Project Overview Document

Ask the AI to help create a comprehensive project overview:

```
