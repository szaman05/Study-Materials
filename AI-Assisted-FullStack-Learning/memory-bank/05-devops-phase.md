5. Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging for production systems
6. Implement security best practices throughout the deployment pipeline
7. Use AI to automate and optimize DevOps workflows
8. Design and implement a complete deployment architecture for full-stack applications
9. Troubleshoot and resolve common deployment and infrastructure issues
