# 🏰 Digital Castle Learning Journey

Welcome to your Digital Castle Learning Journey! This repository contains a comprehensive 30-day curriculum to take you from complete beginner to building full-stack web applications with AI integration.

## 📚 Learning Path

This learning path is structured around the metaphor of building a digital castle:

- **Frontend**: The visible parts of your castle (walls, windows, doors)
- **Backend**: The hidden systems that power your castle
- **Databases**: Treasure vaults to store your castle's information
- **TypeScript**: Blueprints that ensure castle parts fit together properly
- **AI**: Magical assistants that bring your castle to life

## 🗺️ Course Structure

The course is organized into 6 phases, each building on the previous:

### Phase 1: Web Fundamentals (Days 1-5)
