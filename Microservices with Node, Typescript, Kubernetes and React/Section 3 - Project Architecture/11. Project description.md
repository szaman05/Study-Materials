# Freelance Marketplace Microservices Overview

In this tutorial, we will build a freelance marketplace application with various microservices. Below is an overview of the application and the services involved.

## Application Overview

We are building a freelance marketplace where:
- **Sellers** can create gigs.
- **Buyers** can purchase gigs or custom gigs.
- Users start as buyers and can opt to become sellers.
- Communication between buyers and sellers is facilitated.

Note: We will focus on essential features for learning purposes, not every feature of a full-fledged marketplace.

## Services Overview

### 1. API Gateway
- Acts as the entry point to the microservices.
- Facilitates communication between the client and microservices.

### 2. Notification Service
- Handles sending emails to users.
- Notifications include account confirmation, order completion, and purchase notifications.

### 3. Authentication (Auth) Service
- Manages user authentication using email and username.
- Users can log in with either their email or username.

### 4. User Service
- Manages profiles for both buyers and sellers.
- Combines buyer and seller profiles to reduce complexity.

### 5. Gig Service
- Handles CRUD operations for gigs.
- Integrates with Elasticsearch for powerful search capabilities.

### 6. Chat Service
- Manages messaging between buyers and sellers.

### 7. Order Service
- Combines orders and payments.
- Uses Stripe as the payment gateway.
- Could be split into separate services for orders and payments in a real-world scenario.

### 8. Review and Rating Service
- Manages reviews and ratings between buyers and sellers.

## Design Considerations

- Some services are merged to avoid complexity and potential errors in a tutorial setting.
- Elasticsearch and Kibana are used for monitoring and logging.

## Additional Notes

- The API Gateway is crucial for the microservice architecture.
- The current setup includes seven services, which could expand if services are split further.
