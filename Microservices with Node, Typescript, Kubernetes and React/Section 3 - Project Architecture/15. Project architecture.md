# Project Architecture for Freelance Marketplace

In this video, we explore the project architecture for our microservices-based freelance marketplace. This includes the structure and communication flow between various components.

## Key Components

### 1. Client
- Could be a mobile or web application.
- Communicates with the API gateway using HTTP/HTTPS and Socket.IO for real-time events.

### 2. API Gateway
- Central point for all client requests.
- Manages communication with microservices via HTTP/HTTPS.
- Handles token management and validation.

### 3. Elasticsearch and Kibana
- **Elasticsearch**: Stores gig data and log data for search and monitoring.
- **Kibana**: Provides a dashboard for visualizing data from Elasticsearch.

### 4. RabbitMQ
- Used for event-driven communication between microservices.
- A single instance serves the entire application.

### 5. Microservices
- **Notification Service**: Listens for events and sends emails.
- **Auth Service**: Uses MySQL for data storage and connects to RabbitMQ.
- **User Service**: Connects to MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
- **Gig Service**: Stores data in Elasticsearch and MongoDB.
- **Chat Service**: Uses MongoDB and RabbitMQ.
- **Order Service**: Connects to MongoDB and RabbitMQ.
- **Review Service**: Uses PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.

## Communication and Data Flow

- **Client to API Gateway**: HTTP/HTTPS and Socket.IO.
- **API Gateway to Microservices**: HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Microservices to Elasticsearch**: Log and monitoring data sent for analysis.
- **Microservices to RabbitMQ**: Event-driven communication for inter-service messaging.

## Design Considerations

- **Database per Service Pattern**: Each microservice has its own database.
- **Security**: Only the API gateway is accessible externally; all other services are internal.
- **Scalability and Monitoring**: Use of Elasticsearch and Kibana for efficient data handling and visualization.
