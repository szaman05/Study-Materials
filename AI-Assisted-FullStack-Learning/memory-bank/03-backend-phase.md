# Backend Phase

## Phase Overview

The Backend Phase focuses on server-side development using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL with AI assistance. This phase builds upon the previous phases and teaches how to create robust, scalable APIs and implement database persistence for applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, the learner should be able to:

1. Build RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.js
2. Design and implement database schemas in PostgreSQL
3. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. Create middleware for request processing and validation
5. Write server-side business logic with proper error handling
6. Test and debug backend applications effectively

## Key Concepts

### Node.js Fundamentals
- Event loop and non-blocking I/O
- Module system (CommonJS and ES Modules)
- Package management with npm/yarn
- Asynchronous programming patterns
- Error handling

### Express.js Application Structure
- Routing and controllers
- Middleware pipeline
- Request and response objects
- Error handling middleware
- Application configuration

### Database Integration
- PostgreSQL basics
- Connecting to databases from Node.js
- ORM concepts (using Sequelize or similar)
- Data modeling and relationships
- Query optimization

### API Development
- RESTful API design principles
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Authentication with JWT
- Role-based access control

## Learning Materials

This phase consists of the following learning materials:

1. [01-Node-Express-Fundamentals.md](../03-Backend/01-Node-Express-Fundamentals.md) - Learning Node.js and Express.js fundamentals
2. [02-Database-Integration.md](../03-Backend/02-Database-Integration.md) - PostgreSQL integration with Node.js
3. [03-REST-API-Development.md](../03-Backend/03-REST-API-Development.md) - Developing RESTful APIs
4. [04-Authentication-Authorization.md](../03-Backend/04-Authentication-Authorization.md) - Implementing authentication and authorization
5. [05-Middleware-Validation.md](../03-Backend/05-Middleware-Validation.md) - Middleware and request validation
6. [06-Testing-Backend.md](../03-Backend/06-Testing-Backend.md) - Testing backend applications

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Express Server
- Create a simple Express server with multiple routes
- Implement middleware for logging and error handling
- Structure the application using the MVC pattern

### Exercise 2: Database Integration
- Design a database schema for a simple application
- Set up PostgreSQL and connect it to an Express application
- Implement CRUD operations for multiple resources

### Exercise 3: Authentication System
- Implement user registration and login endpoints
- Add JWT-based authentication
- Create protected routes with role-based access control

### Exercise 4: Mini Backend Project
- Build a complete API for a product/inventory management system
- Implement all CRUD operations with proper validation
- Add authentication and authorization
- Include error handling and logging
- Write tests for the API endpoints

## Transition Criteria

You are ready to move to the Microservices Phase when you can:

1. Design and implement RESTful APIs with proper architecture
2. Create and manage database schemas and relationships
3. Implement authentication and authorization systems
4. Write effective middleware for request processing
5. Test backend applications and APIs
6. Complete all exercises in this phase successfully

## AI Prompting Strategies

### For API Design
- "Help me design a RESTful API for [specific domain/application]"
- "What endpoints should I create for [specific functionality]?"
- "How should I structure the request and response bodies for [specific endpoint]?"

### For Database Integration
- "Design a PostgreSQL schema for [specific domain/application]"
- "Help me write Sequelize models for these entities: [list entities]"
- "What's the best way to implement [specific relationship] between these tables?"

### For Authentication
- "Show me how to implement JWT authentication in an Express application"
- "How do I create middleware to protect routes based on user roles?"
- "What's the best way to handle refresh tokens in a Node.js application?"

### For Troubleshooting
- "I'm getting this error when trying to connect to PostgreSQL: [error message]. How do I fix it?"
- "My endpoint is returning [current response] but I want it to return [desired response]. What's wrong?"
- "How can I debug this issue with my middleware pipeline: [describe issue]?"
