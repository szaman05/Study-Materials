# Design Decisions for Microservices

In this video, we discuss the design decisions made for building our microservices. These decisions are flexible and can be adapted based on different needs or preferences.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. API Gateway
- **Central Communication**: All client requests must go through the API gateway for security.
- **Communication Type**: HTTP-based with synchronous request-response and real-time communication using Socket.IO.

### 2. Inter-Process Communication
- **Event-Driven**: Communication between microservices will be event-driven using RabbitMQ.
- **No Direct HTTP Requests**: Services will not use HTTP requests for inter-service communication.

### 3. Token Management
- **Handled by API Gateway**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be generated and managed by the API gateway.
- **Auth Service Exception**: The auth service will generate tokens but not store them.

### 4. Service Accessibility
- **Internal Access Only**: Microservices, except the API gateway, will not be accessible from outside for security reasons.
- **Token Validation**: Requests from the API gateway will include a token for validation.

### 5. Error Handling
- **Client Errors**: Sent to the API gateway, which forwards them to the client.
- **Server Errors**: Logged directly to Elasticsearch and monitored via Kibana.

## Additional Notes

- **Flexibility**: These design decisions are not fixed and can be improved or adapted.
- **Feedback**: Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
