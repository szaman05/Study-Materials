1. Plan and architect a complete full stack application from scratch
2. Implement a scalable and maintainable backend with multiple microservices
3. Create a responsive, accessible, and performant frontend interface
4. Design and implement a comprehensive database schema across services
5. Set up robust DevOps pipelines for continuous integration and deployment
6. Deploy your application to a production environment with monitoring
7. Document your project thoroughly for users and future developers
8. Present and demonstrate your project effectively
9. Use AI tools strategically throughout the entire development lifecycle
10. Troubleshoot and resolve complex issues across the full stack
